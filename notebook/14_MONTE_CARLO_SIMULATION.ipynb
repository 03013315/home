    "As the 20th century progressed, the limitations of this approach became increasingly clear. Reasons for this include:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 An increased interest in <b>the social sciences</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "2 As the systems to be modeled grew <b>increasingly complex</b>, it seemed easier to successively refine a series of simulation models than to construct accurate analytic models\n",
    "\n",
    "3 It is often easier to extract useful intermediate results from a simulation than from an analytical model\n",
    "\n",
    "4 The <b>availability of computers</b> made it feasible to run large-scale simulations\n",
    "```\n",
    "Simulation attempts to build an experimental device, called <b>a model</b>, that will provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation models are <b>descriptive</b>, <b>not prescriptive</b>. They tell how a system works under given conditions; not how to arrange the conditions to make the system work best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation models can be classified along <b>three dimensions</b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Deterministic versus stochastic,\n",
    "\n",
    "• Static versus dynamic, and\n",
    "\n",
    "• Discrete versus continuous."

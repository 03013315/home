    "`cProfile` and `profile` provide deterministic profiling of Python programs. \n",

    "A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed. These statistics can be formatted into reports via the `pstats` module.\n",

    "The Python standard library provides two different implementations of the same profiling interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cProfile` is recommended for most users; it’s a C extension with reasonable overhead that makes it suitable for profiling long-running programs. Based on `lsprof`, contributed by Brett Rosen and Ted Czotter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `profile`, a pure Python module whose interface is imitated by cProfile, but which adds significant overhead to profiled programs. If you’re trying to extend the profiler in some way, the task might be easier with this module. Originally designed and written by Jim Roskind.\n",
